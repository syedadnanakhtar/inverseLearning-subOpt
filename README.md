# Inverse Optimal Control with Suboptimality Loss
The project is an implementation of the paper **_Learning for Control: An Inverse Optimization Approach**, co-authored by Syed Adnan Akhtar, Arman Sharifi Kolarijani, and Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani at TU Delft, Netherlands. Please refer to the paper for more details

- **[Learning for Control: An Inverse Optimization Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9336679)** [Paper]
- Demonstration Video (in progress)

The repo has been tested to be working on MATLAB 2018-2020 (Ubuntu 16.04 & Windows 10)

# Prerequisites
The code requires installation of the following 
- MOSEK - A toolbox to solve LPs, QPs, SOCPs, SDPs and MIPs. Please find more information [here](https://www.mosek.com/).
- YALMIP - A toolbox to provide an interfact to the solver. Please find more information [here](https://yalmip.github.io/).
- MATLAB.
